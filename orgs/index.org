title Upgrading Chassis Redundant Pairs

[*]     --> State_1
State_1 --> State_2 : Beg Pri DL
State_2 --> State_3 : End Pri DL
State_3 --> State_4 : Beg Sec DL
State_4 --> State_5 : End Sec DL
State_5 --> [*]

note right of State_2
Secondary loses Heartbeat contact with Primary.
Therefore Secondary becomes Active.
end note

note right of State_3
Heartbeat contact resumes but versions don't match.
But as of APEX 2.5.0 according to release notes:
    "...when a GigE/QAM configuration mismatch occurs,
    the ACTIVE APEX will not go into a FAULT state and
    continue to source the Video."
Therefore Secondary stays Active.
end note

note right of State_4
Primary loses Heartbeat contact with Secondary
and can no longer see that versions don't match.
Therefore Primary becomes Active.
end note

note right of State_5
Heartbeat contact resumes and versions match,
so Secondary enables redundancy but enters Standby.
end note
